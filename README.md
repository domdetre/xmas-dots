Xmas dots with FastLed

Randomly lights up a led with a fadeIn effect in the loop. 

Also randomly lights down a led in the loop.

Sometimes it lights down the one previously lighted up, creating a blink effect. Sometimes the led being lighten up is has been already lighten up previously, creating a blinky color changing effect.

Those features are wanted as it creates a nice random sparky effect which matches the christmas feeling.
